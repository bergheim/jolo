Jolo - not quite Yolo, but close enough.

Jolo is meant to help you get a project up in minutes. Spin up isolated devcontainers with AI agents that work together (and will let you know when they are done if you have notifications set up). It is designed around being as provider agnostic as possible. So for instance, all agents will get the same skills, and will use the same project based system for long term memory instead of just their own.

This project started as a way to isolate my Emacs config automatically to be able to easily try changes there. But Emacs is just a git repo. So I made it work with any repo, and now Emacs is just there along for the ride. It is still a great fit for the project itself because that means you can use your favorite editor with your own config, and with packages like [[https://github.com/manzaltu/claude-code-ide.el][claude-code-ide]] or [[https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell][agent-shell]], also without any restrictions set.

Alpine Linux container with Emacs, agents (Claude/Gemini/Codex) without permission checks, language servers, browser automation, lots of guard rails (linters, pre-commit hooks), and all the developer tools I've come to expect on regular systems.

Each ~jolo up~ invocation gets an isolated container with its own (permanent) port, shell history, and AI credentials. Every container starts a 5-window tmux session: Emacs, Claude, Gemini, Codex, and a spare shell.

~spawn~ mode fans out N worktrees with agents round-robin through Claude, Gemini, and Codex. Each gets a unique ~$PORT~ (4000, 4001, ...). Ports 4000-5000 are forwarded to the host.

* Quick Start

#+begin_src bash
# Install
ln -s $(pwd)/jolo.py ~/.local/bin/jolo

# Scaffold a new project
jolo create myapp

# Clone a repo and start a devcontainer
jolo clone https://github.com/org/repo.git

# Start devcontainer in any git project
cd ~/myproject && jolo up

# Fire and forget — AI works in background
jolo up -p "add OAuth login"

# Spawn parallel agents on the same problem
jolo spawn 5 -p "implement the auth system"

# Research mode (persistent repo at ~/jolo/research)
jolo research "what is an apple"

# Deep research: claude + codex in parallel, gemini synthesis
jolo research --deep "compare sqlite and postgres for local-first apps"

# Start an isolated worktree directly on any git repo
cd ~/myproject && jolo tree feature-x

# Jump into a running container (fzf picker)
jolo attach

# Clean up orphaned/stopped containers and images
jolo prune

# Unified delete for worktrees and projects
jolo delete myapp
