#+TITLE: jolo

Jolo - not quite Yolo, but close enough. Program like it's 2026!

Jolo is meant to help you get a project up in minutes. Spin up isolated devcontainers with AI agents that work together (and will let you know when they are done).

Alpine Linux container with Emacs, YOLO-enabled Claude/Gemini/Codex, language servers, browser automation, lots of guard rails (linters, pre-commit hooks), and the usual dev tools.

* Quick Start

#+begin_src bash
# Install
ln -s $(pwd)/jolo.py ~/.local/bin/jolo

# Start devcontainer in any git project
cd ~/myproject && jolo up

# Fire and forget — AI works in background
jolo up -p "add OAuth login"

# Spawn parallel agents on the same problem
jolo spawn 5 -p "implement the auth system"

# Jump into a running container (fzf picker)
jolo open

# Clean up orphaned/stopped containers and images
jolo prune

# Unified delete for worktrees and projects
jolo delete myapp
#+end_src

* Layout

#+begin_example
jolo.py                  # the CLI launcher
_jolo/                   # CLI logic package
container/               # scripts baked into the image (wt, browser-check, motd)
templates/               # scaffolds for new projects
openspec/                # structured change workflow
docs/                    # research and status notes
#+end_example

* How It Works

Each ~jolo up~ invocation gets an isolated container with its own port, shell history, and AI credentials. Every container starts a 5-window tmux session: Emacs, Claude, Gemini, Codex, and a spare shell.

~spawn~ mode fans out N worktrees with agents round-robinning through Claude, Gemini, and Codex. Each gets a unique ~$PORT~ (4000, 4001, ...). Ports 4000-5000 are forwarded to the host.
