* Gemini CLI crashes on Alpine/musl                        :musl:nodejs:gemini:
:PROPERTIES:
:DATE: 2026-02-09
:END:

node-pty prebuilt binary segfaults during PTY cleanup on musl libc.
The command itself executes fine — crash happens on PTY destroy/resize after exit.

** Root cause

~@lydell/node-pty-linux-x64/pty.node~ is compiled against glibc.
~ldd~ shows missing symbols: ~__asprintf_chk~, ~fcntl64~ (glibc-specific),
plus ~napi_*~ symbols (resolved by Node at runtime, not an issue).

~gcompat~ makes the binary loadable but ~forkpty()~ still segfaults
at the native level during cleanup — uncatchable by JS try/catch.

** Fix

Set ~tools.shell.enableInteractiveShell: false~ in ~settings.json~.
This bypasses node-pty entirely and uses ~child_process.spawn()~ fallback
(see ~shellExecutionService.js:86-99~).

Applied in ~_jolo/setup.py:setup_credential_cache()~ — merges the setting
into gemini's settings.json when copying credentials to container.

** Key files

- ~_jolo/setup.py~ — merges ~enableInteractiveShell: false~ after credential copy
- ~Containerfile~ — ~procps~ (GNU pgrep), ~diffutils~ (GNU diff for apheleia)
- Gemini source: ~shellExecutionService.js~, ~getPty.js~, ~shell-utils.js~

** Refs

- https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/14087 (Alpine crash, open)
- https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/4676 (Alpine shell hang)
- https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/3448 (bash not found)

** What ~enableInteractiveShell: false~ loses

- Color output (stripped to plain text)
- Interactive programs (vim, less) don't work in shell tool
- ~isatty()~ returns false

None of this matters for AI agent usage in YOLO mode.

* BusyBox vs GNU tools in Alpine container                 :alpine:busybox:
:PROPERTIES:
:DATE: 2026-02-09
:END:

Alpine ships BusyBox which lacks many GNU flags. Tools that break:

| Tool | Missing flag | Fix package |
|------+--------------+-------------|
| pgrep | ~-g~ (process group) | ~procps~ |
| diff | ~--rcs~, ~--strip-trailing-cr~, ~--text~ | ~diffutils~ |

Emacs apheleia uses ~diff --rcs~ for formatting patches — fails silently
with BusyBox, shows "Output file descriptor of apheleia-diff is closed".
