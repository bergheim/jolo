# Doc Critique

## Overview
Provide a focused critique of writing quality, structure, and completeness while keeping the author's tone intact. Emphasize suggestions and minimal examples over rewriting.

## Workflow
1. Confirm intent and audience. If missing, ask up to two quick questions.
2. Assess the thread: opening, hierarchy, transitions, and whether the reader can follow the arc.
3. Identify gaps: missing prerequisites, assumptions, commands, expected outputs, or next steps.
4. Flag ambiguity and risk: unclear claims, overpromises, or details that could mislead.
5. Check tone fit: preserve the author's voice. Do not rewrite unless explicitly asked.

## Output Format
- Summary: 1-2 sentences on overall quality and main issue.
- Strengths: bullets.
- Issues: bullets, ordered by impact.
- Suggestions: concrete, minimal edits or micro-examples (keep to 1-2 lines each).
- Questions: only if needed to resolve ambiguity or missing context.

## Constraints
- Preserve the author's voice. Do not "polish" into a generic tone.
- Prefer guidance and pointed suggestions over full rewrites.
- If a rewrite is requested, confirm scope and keep edits localized.
