Jolo - not quite Yolo, but close enough. Program like it's 2026!

Jolo is a high-performance development environment and orchestration harness designed for the effective deployment of autonomous AI agents. It provides a standardized, musl-based Alpine Linux environment where multiple agents can operate in parallel with secure identity persistence, specialized browser automation, and sophisticated workspace management.

* Core Philosophy: An Engineering Harness for Agents

Most AI tools are designed for interactive, chat-based assistance. Jolo is an infrastructure layer designed for **autonomous agent control**.

- **Environment Consistency**: Every agent operates in an identical, isolated container. This eliminates environment-induced failures and ensures that agents have a predictable set of tools (runtimes, LSPs, and linters) at their disposal.
- **Provider-Agnostic Intelligence**: Jolo abstracts agent capabilities into a unified skill system. Whether using Claude, Gemini, or Codex, agents share the same ~.agents/skills/~ and a project-based long-term memory system.
- **Authenticated Identity (GPG)**: Jolo mounts the host's ~S.gpg-agent~ socket to the container. This allows agents to sign commits with your GPG key while ensuring that **private key material remains strictly on the host**. The agent can request signatures, but cannot extract keys.
- **Agent-First Browser Automation**: Built-in ~browser-check~ provides ARIA accessibility tree snapshots, reducing token context by ~93% compared to raw HTML. This allows agents to "see" the page structure and interactive elements without being overwhelmed by DOM noise.

* Quick Start

#+begin_src bash
# Install
ln -s $(pwd)/jolo.py ~/.local/bin/jolo

# Scaffold a new project with agent-ready defaults
jolo create myapp

# Start the harness in any git project
cd ~/myproject && jolo up

# Execute a task autonomously in the background
jolo up -p "implement the storage layer using sqlite"

# Spawn parallel agents to explore different solutions
jolo spawn 5 -p "refactor the auth module for OIDC support"

# Orchestration management
jolo open    # Interactive fzf picker to attach to a running session
jolo prune   # Clean up orphaned containers and stale images
jolo delete  # Unified removal of projects and worktrees
#+end_src

* Technical Architecture

** The Runtime Environment
Jolo uses Alpine Linux for its minimal footprint and predictable behavior. Every environment initializes a 5-window tmux session, providing a structured workspace for both agents and human supervisors:
1. **Emacs**: The primary editor, running with a sandboxed configuration.
2. **Claude / Gemini / Codex**: Dedicated windows for the three primary agent types.
3. **Shell**: A zsh instance for manual verification and system tasks.

** Workspace Isolation & Parallelism
Jolo supports two tiers of isolation to manage agent state:
- **jolo tree (Host-side)**: Creates a native git worktree and a dedicated container. This provides total separation for large, risky changes or parallel "spawn" runs.
- **wt (In-container)**: A lightweight command inside the container to manage ephemeral worktrees at ~/workspaces/<name>~. This is the preferred way to handle rapid branching and sub-task exploration without host-side overhead.

** Lifecycle Monitoring
Jolo integrates with ~ntfy.sh~ for asynchronous monitoring. By setting an ~NTFY_TOPIC~, agents will send lifecycle notifications (start, success, failure) to your desktop or mobile device, allowing you to walk away from long-running autonomous tasks.
