#+TITLE: Claude Code Skills - Comprehensive Research
#+DATE: 2026-02-17

* Overview

Claude Code Skills are specialized folders containing instructions (=SKILL.md=),
scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically when relevant to tasks. They
follow the [[https://agentskills.io/specification][Agent Skills open standard]] (agentskills.io), meaning skills work
across multiple AI tools: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot,
Cursor, Windsurf, and others.

Skills were announced October 16, 2025. Custom slash commands (=.claude/commands/=)
have been merged into skills (=.claude/skills/=) -- old commands still work but
skills are the recommended path forward.

Key insight from Simon Willison: skills are "maybe a bigger deal than MCP" because
they are just Markdown with optional scripts, consuming far fewer tokens than MCP
tool definitions.

** Independent Analysis and Reviews

*** Simon Willison: "Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP"
- URL: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/
- Essential read. Key arguments:
  - Skills are just Markdown + YAML + optional scripts -- radically simple.
  - MCP consumes tens of thousands of context tokens; skills use ~100 tokens
    for metadata, <5k when loaded.
  - "I expect we'll see a Cambrian explosion in Skills."
  - CLI tools often better than MCP: LLMs know how to run =cli-tool --help=.
  - Critical remaining challenge: safe sandboxed computing environments.

*** Lee Han Chung: "Claude Agent Skills: A First Principles Deep Dive"
- URL: https://leehanchung.github.io/blogs/2025/10/26/claude-skills-deep-dive/
- Technical deep dive into the architecture. Key findings:
  - Skills are a prompt-based meta-tool architecture.
  - The =Skill= tool (capital S) lives in the API's =tools= array, not the
    system prompt.
  - "There is no algorithmic skill selection. The decision-making happens
    entirely within Claude's reasoning process."
  - Dual-message injection pattern: one visible status indicator, one hidden
    API-level prompt.
  - Distinguishes traditional tools (synchronous, direct) from skills
    (prompt expansion, context modification).

*** Mikhail Shilkov: "Inside Claude Code Skills: Structure, prompts, invocation"
- URL: https://mikhail.io/2025/10/claude-code-skills/
- Technical analysis of how skills work internally. Covers folder structure,
  tool definition, metadata extraction, invocation mechanism.
- Key insight: "on-demand prompt expansion without modifying the core system prompt."

*** Shrivu Shankar: "How I Use Every Claude Code Feature"
- URL: https://blog.sshh.io/p/how-i-use-every-claude-code-feature
- Power user guide. Key recommendations:
  - CLAUDE.md should be curated guardrails, not comprehensive docs.
    Their monorepo's file is 13KB with token "ad space" for teams.
  - Keep slash commands minimal: author uses only =/catchup= and =/pr=.
  - Over-reliance on custom commands signals poor underlying tooling design.
  - Let agents decide when to delegate using built-in =Task()=.
  - Two hook strategies: block-at-submit (validate before commits) and
    hint hooks (non-blocking feedback). Avoid blocking at write time.
  - Agent autonomy through minimal abstraction: provide context via CLAUDE.md,
    let agents script solutions.

*** Jesse Vincent / blog.fsck.com: "Superpowers"
- URL: https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/09/superpowers/
- Origin story of the superpowers framework. Key insights:
  - Skills as "executable knowledge" -- documented, testable capabilities.
  - Approach enables agents to self-improve: "Read this. Think about it.
    Write down the new stuff you learned."
  - Persuasion principles (Cialdini) enhance agent compliance.
  - Skill testing uses pressure scenarios: production system "costing $5k/minute"
    to test time-pressure responses, sunk-cost dilemmas.

* Notable Individual Skills and Patterns

** The Ralph Wiggum Technique
- Origin: Geoffrey Huntley
- Official plugin: =claude-code/plugins/ralph-wiggum/= in the anthropics/claude-code repo
- Community implementation: https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code
- Concept: A Stop hook intercepts Claude's exit, re-feeds the original prompt.
  Each iteration sees modified files and git history from previous runs. Enables
  continuous autonomous development for hours.
- Best for: batch mechanical work with clear completion criteria. Large refactors,
  test coverage, documentation, support ticket triage.
- Philosophy: "Better to fail predictably than succeed unpredictably."
- Intelligent exit detection: dual-condition check requiring both completion
  indicators and explicit EXIT_SIGNAL.
- Coverage: The Register, multiple Medium articles, blog posts.
- Reference: https://awesomeclaude.ai/ralph-wiggum

** The Superpowers Methodology
- The most mature skill-based development workflow.
- Four principles: TDD, systematic over ad-hoc, complexity reduction,
  evidence over claims.
- Seven phases: brainstorming, git worktrees, plan writing, execution (subagent
  or batch), TDD (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR), code review, branch completion.
- Subagent-driven development enables agents to work autonomously for hours
  without deviating from plans.
- 53.1k stars -- the most popular non-official skill project.

** Security Auditing (Trail of Bits)
- Professional-grade security skills from a leading security firm.
- CodeQL and Semgrep integration for static analysis.
- Variant analysis across codebases.
- Smart contract security for 6 blockchains.
- YARA rule authoring with linting and atom analysis.

** Homunculus (Self-Evolving Agent)
- Learns your patterns through hook-based observation.
- Auto-generates instincts (small behavioral rules).
- Instincts cluster into larger structures: Commands, Skills, Subagents, Hooks.
- The =/homunculus:evolve= command triggers structure emergence.

** CloudRouter (Cloud VM/GPU Provisioning)
- Gives agents their own machines.
- Supports T4, L4, A10G, A100, H100 GPUs.
- File sync, browser automation, VS Code in browser.

* SKILL.md Format and Structure

** Required File Structure

Every skill is a directory with =SKILL.md= as the entrypoint:

#+begin_example
my-skill/
+-- SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
+-- template.md        # Template for Claude to fill in
+-- examples/
|   +-- sample.md      # Example output showing expected format
+-- scripts/
|   +-- validate.sh    # Script Claude can execute
+-- references/
    +-- guide.md       # Documentation loaded when needed
#+end_example

** YAML Frontmatter

#+begin_src yaml
---
name: my-skill-name
description: What this skill does and when to use it
argument-hint: "[issue-number]"
disable-model-invocation: false
user-invocable: true
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
context: fork
agent: Explore
---
#+end_src

| Field                      | Required    | Description                                        |
|----------------------------+-------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| name                       | No          | Display name (max 64 chars, lowercase/numbers/-)   |
| description                | Recommended | What it does + when to use it (max 1024 chars)     |
| argument-hint              | No          | Hint for autocomplete, e.g. "[filename] [format]"  |
| disable-model-invocation   | No          | true = only user can invoke (for deploy, commit)   |
| user-invocable             | No          | false = hidden from / menu (background knowledge)  |
| allowed-tools              | No          | Tools Claude can use without asking permission      |
| model                      | No          | Model override when skill is active                |
| context                    | No          | "fork" to run in isolated subagent                 |
| agent                      | No          | Subagent type (Explore, Plan, general-purpose)     |
| hooks                      | No          | Hooks scoped to this skill's lifecycle             |

** Naming Conventions

Anthropic recommends gerund form (verb + -ing):
- =processing-pdfs= (preferred)
- =analyzing-spreadsheets= (preferred)
- =pdf-processing= (acceptable noun phrase)
- =process-pdfs= (acceptable action-oriented)
- =helper=, =utils=, =tools= (avoid -- too vague)

** String Substitutions

| Variable               | Description                                    |
|------------------------+------------------------------------------------|
| =$ARGUMENTS=           | All arguments passed when invoking              |
| =$ARGUMENTS[N]=        | Specific argument by 0-based index              |
| =$N=                   | Shorthand for =$ARGUMENTS[N]=                   |
| =${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}= | Current session ID                              |

** Shell Preprocessing

The =!`command`= syntax runs shell commands before content is sent to Claude:

#+begin_src yaml
---
name: pr-summary
description: Summarize changes in a pull request
context: fork
agent: Explore
---

## Pull request context
- PR diff: !`gh pr diff`
- PR comments: !`gh pr view --comments`
- Changed files: !`gh pr diff --name-only`

## Your task
Summarize this pull request...
#+end_src

** Extended Thinking

Include the word "ultrathink" anywhere in skill content to enable extended thinking.

* Best Practices and Patterns

** Core Principles (from Anthropic's authoring guide)

1. *Concise is key.* The context window is a public good. Only add context
   Claude does not already have. Challenge each piece of information:
   "Does Claude really need this explanation?"

2. *Set appropriate degrees of freedom.* Match specificity to task fragility:
   - High freedom: text instructions when multiple approaches are valid
   - Medium freedom: pseudocode/scripts with parameters
   - Low freedom: exact scripts for fragile operations (DB migrations)

3. *Test with all models you plan to use.* What works for Opus may need more
   detail for Haiku.

** Description Writing

- Write in third person (description is injected into system prompt).
- Include both what the skill does AND when to use it.
- Be specific with key terms -- Claude uses descriptions to choose from 100+ skills.
- Good: "Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents.
  Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs."
- Bad: "Helps with documents."

** Progressive Disclosure

Three tiers of information loading:
1. *Frontmatter disclosure* (~100 tokens): name + description scanned at startup.
2. *Skill selection* (<5k tokens): full SKILL.md loaded when chosen.
3. *Execution*: supporting files, scripts loaded on demand.

Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.
Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md -- avoid deeply nested file chains.

** Skill Types

- *Reference content*: conventions, patterns, style guides. Runs inline.
- *Task content*: step-by-step instructions for specific actions. Often
  =disable-model-invocation: true= for manual trigger only.

** Invocation Control

| Frontmatter                      | User can invoke | Claude can invoke |
|----------------------------------+-----------------+-------------------|
| (default)                        | Yes             | Yes               |
| disable-model-invocation: true   | Yes             | No                |
| user-invocable: false            | No              | Yes               |

** Common Patterns

*** Template Pattern
Provide templates for output format. Match strictness to requirements.

*** Examples Pattern
Input/output pairs, just like prompt engineering.

*** Conditional Workflow
Guide through decision points: "Creating new content? -> Follow creation
workflow. Editing existing? -> Follow editing workflow."

*** Feedback Loop
Run validator -> fix errors -> repeat. Greatly improves output quality.

*** Plan-Validate-Execute
Create intermediate =changes.json= file -> validate with script -> execute.
Catches errors before changes are applied.

** Evaluation-Driven Development

Anthropic recommends building evaluations BEFORE writing documentation:
1. Identify gaps: run Claude without skill, document failures.
2. Create evaluations: 3 scenarios testing gaps.
3. Establish baseline: measure performance without skill.
4. Write minimal instructions to address gaps.
5. Iterate: execute evaluations, compare, refine.

** Iterative Development with Two Claudes

Use "Claude A" (the expert) to design skills and "Claude B" (the user) to test:
1. Complete a task without a skill, noting what context you provide.
2. Ask Claude A to create a skill capturing the pattern.
3. Review for conciseness.
4. Test with Claude B on similar tasks.
5. Bring observations back to Claude A for refinement.

** Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Windows-style paths (backslashes). Always use forward slashes.
- Offering too many options. Provide a default with an escape hatch.
- Deeply nested file references (Claude may only partially read).
- Time-sensitive information (use "old patterns" sections).
- Vague descriptions ("helps with documents").
- Over-explaining what Claude already knows.
- Inconsistent terminology.

* The Skills Ecosystem in 2026

** Plugin Marketplace

Skills are distributed as plugins through marketplaces:

#+begin_src
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
/plugin update superpowers
#+end_src

The official Anthropic marketplace (=claude-plugins-official=) is automatically
available. Community marketplaces can be added with =/plugin marketplace add=.

** Skills vs Other Extension Points

| Extension   | Purpose                                           |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| Skills      | Reusable instructions + scripts, loaded on demand |
| Agents      | Custom subagents in .claude/agents/               |
| Rules       | Topic-specific instructions in .claude/rules/*.md |
| Hooks       | Deterministic scripts on specific events          |
| Plugins     | Distributable packages bundling all of the above  |
| CLAUDE.md   | Persistent context / "constitution"               |

** Cross-Tool Compatibility

The Agent Skills open standard (agentskills.io) means skills work across:
- Claude Code
- GitHub Copilot (VS Code, CLI, coding agent)
- Codex CLI
- Gemini CLI
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- OpenCode
- Antigravity

Claude Code extends the standard with: invocation control, subagent execution,
dynamic context injection.

* Example Skills

** Minimal Explain-Code Skill

#+begin_src yaml
---
name: explain-code
description: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies. Use when
  explaining how code works, teaching about a codebase, or when the user
  asks "how does this work?"
---

When explaining code, always include:

1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare the code to something from everyday life
2. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships
3. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens
4. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?

Keep explanations conversational.

* Key Takeaways

1. *Skills > MCP for most use cases.* Token-efficient, simple to create, portable
   across tools. MCP still useful for authenticated API access but skills handle
   workflows better.

2. *Start with superpowers.* The obra/superpowers framework (53k+ stars) is the
   most mature and battle-tested skill-based development workflow. Install it
   and build on top of it.

3. *Progressive disclosure is the key design principle.* Keep metadata tiny
   (~100 tokens), SKILL.md focused (<500 lines), and supporting files loaded
   only on demand.

4. *Write descriptions as if selling to Claude.* The description is how Claude
   decides whether to invoke your skill from potentially 100+ available skills.
   Be specific and include trigger contexts.

5. *Evaluation-driven development.* Build evals before writing skills. Test with
   real scenarios, not imagined ones. Iterate with two Claude instances.

6. *The ecosystem is exploding.* From 0 to 70k+ stars on the official repo,
   53k+ on superpowers, 24k+ on awesome-claude-code, all in ~4 months since
   the October 2025 announcement.

7. *Security skills deserve attention.* Trail of Bits' professional security
   skills demonstrate the quality ceiling for skill development.

8. *Ralph Wiggum for batch work.* The autonomous loop technique enables
   overnight batch processing for mechanical tasks.

9. *Homunculus for self-improvement.* The self-rewriting plugin pattern points
   toward agents that improve their own configurations over time.

10. *The Agent Skills open standard* means investing in skill creation pays off
    across multiple tools, not just Claude Code.
