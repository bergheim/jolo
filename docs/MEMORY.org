Shared knowledge base for all agents working on this project.
Read on session start. Write discoveries, conventions, and patterns here.
Tag entries with keywords (e.g., =:auth:perf:musl:=) for searchability.

* Conventions

- Org-mode preferred over markdown for project docs                    :docs:
- Pre-commit hooks must pass before committing                         :workflow:
- System Python has no pip; use =uv= for everything                   :python:

* Patterns

- Secrets flow: =get_secrets()= -> =os.environ.update()= -> =${localEnv:...}= in devcontainer.json :jolo:
- =devcontainer_up(remove_existing=True)= tears down old container first — skip port checks :jolo:
- Motd runs in all tmux panes; per-window commands belong in =dev.yml= :tmux:

* Gotchas

- Grep/Glob tools sometimes miss =_jolo/*.py= — use =**/_jolo/**/*.py= or =ls= :tooling:
- Alpine uses musl; glibc .so/.elc files are not compatible           :musl:
- =gh= auth token is in OS keyring, not =hosts.yml= — need =gh auth token= to extract :gh:
