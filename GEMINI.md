# STICKY INSTRUCTIONS: PLAN FIRST
- **NEVER** use implementation tools (`replace`, `write_file`, `run_shell_command` for modification, etc.) until a plan has been explicitly proposed and agreed upon with the user.
- **INVESTIGATION IS OK**: You are encouraged and expected to use `read_file`, `search_file_content`, `list_directory`, and `glob` to thoroughly understand the situation before proposing a plan.
- **NO SILENT FIXES**: Even if a fix seems obvious, describe it first and wait for approval.
- **CLI PERMISSIONS**: The user handles tool call permissions via the CLI; your job is to handle the *logical* agreement on the strategy before attempting the work.
